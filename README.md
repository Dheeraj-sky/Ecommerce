## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your development machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Install and configure MongoDB. You can download MongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- **Git**: Make sure you have Git installed to clone this repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-mern.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd e-commerce-mern
   ```

3. Install the server dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the client dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure your environment variables. Use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```

7. Start the client (in a separate terminal window):

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

8. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

- `client`: The front-end codebase built with React.js.
- `server`: The back-end codebase built with Node.js and Express.js.

## Configuration

- Database configuration: In the `server/config` directory, you can configure the MongoDB connection in `db.js`.
- Environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory for environment-specific configuration. Refer to `.env.example` for required variables.

## Deployment

To deploy this application to a production environment, follow these general steps:

1. Set up a production-ready server or cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).

2. Configure the environment variables in your production environment based on the `.env.example` file.

3. Build the client-side code for production:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

4. Deploy both the server and client to your hosting environment.

5. Make sure to configure a production-ready database, web server, and any necessary security measures.
